Logarithm Perl IRC Bot
Version 0.8

Installing and Running:
	Uncompress the source or checkout the cvs into the directory you want
	to install to, configure as necessary, and run using the logarithm.sh
	script (which will automatically restart the bot if the perl script
	exits).  Alternatively, you can cd into the source dir and run the
	logarithm.pl script directly.  Note: the bot is not run as a daemon
	and will print status information to the terminal it starts on.

Configuring:
	Logarithm has a permissions system so before running the bot for the
	first type, you should register your nick using the passwd.pl script
	in tools (passwd.pl <nick> <password> [<hostmask>] where hostmask is
	a string with '*' wildcards that is matched with the host you are
	connecting to IRC from in order to automatically identify you).  You
	should also add yourself with a global access level of 500 by
	modifying the etc/access file with a line <nick>:500.  See the
	etc/access.example.

	Configuration options are stored in the etc/options.conf file for
	global options and etc/<channel>/options.conf for channel-specific
	options.  These files can be managed through the bot itself using the
	options command or they can be edited directly using a text editor. If
	the file changes while logarithm is running, the new file will be
	loaded.  Every time a change is made through logarithm, the
	option.conf file is written to disk.  All options are stored in the
	form <option> = "<value>","<value",...  See the Options section for a
	list of all the available options.

Using:
	Commands can be executed by users in the same channel as logarithm
	though the channel itself or by sending private messages directly to
	logarithm.  Some of these commands require a certain level of access
	privilege which is represented as a number between 0 and 500 where
	0 is the least privileged and 500 is the most privileged.  Only the
	owner of the bot should have an access level of 500.  Logarithm
	maintains a list of access levels for each channel and a global list
	which applies in any channel.  A user must register with logarithm
	using the register command and either use the id command to identify
	themselves or set their hostmask to be automatically identified.  There
	is only one global password list so users need not register in each
	channel.  Users who are not identified have a level of 0.  Users who
	are identified but who have no record in an access list have a level 1.

Plugins:
	Plugins are activate in all channels unless they have a specific
	mechanism that allows them to ignore certain channels.  Plugins can be
	enabled or disabled using the plugin command.  The 'plugins' option in
	the options.conf file contains a list of plugins to load when logarithm
	starts and is modified when the plugin command is used.

Commands:
	All commands can either be sent to logarithm as a private message or
	sent to the channel occupied by logarithm with a special prefix append
	to the command name.  Certain commands will assume the channel is the
	current channel if one is not provided.  The prefix is '!' by default
	and can be changed using the 'command_designator' option.  The
	following is a brief list of commands.

	access [<channel>] [<nick>]
		Outputs the access granted to the nick for the specified
		channel.  If no nick is specified, your nick is assumed.  Your
		hostmask (regardless of whether you specify a nick) is printed
		in brackets at the end of the message.

	add [<channel>] <nick> <access>
		Adds the nick to the access list for the specified channel with
		the specified access level.

	bye
		Terminate logarithm.  If the logarithm.sh script is being used,
		logarithm will restart after 15 seconds so this acts more like
		a reboot command.

	del [<channel>] <nick>
		Delete the nick from the access list for the specified channel.

	id <password>
		Identify yourself to logarithm.

	join <channel>
		Cause logarithm to join the specified channel.

	leave <channel>
		Cause logarithm to leave the specified channel.

	me [<channel>] <message>
		Cause logarithm to output the specified message as an action.

	mod [<channel>] <nick> <access>
		Modify the access level of the specified nick for the specified
		channel.

	options (set|get|add|remove|erase) [<channel>] <option> [<value>]
		Control channel options.
		Set sets the option to <value> replacing any previous value.
		Get returns the value of the specified option.
		Add adds <value> to the existing list of values for option.
		Remove removes <value> from the current list of values.
		Erase deletes the option entirely.

	plugin (enable|disable) <name>
		Enables or disables the plugin of the given name.

	register <nick> <password>
		Registers the nick with the specified password.

	say [<channel>] <message>
		Cause logarithm to say the specified message.

	user (password|hostmask) <value>
		Changes user options.  You must be identified.  'password' will
		change the current password for your nick.  'hostmask' will
		change the hostmask to use for automatic identification.

Global Options:
	channels:
		A list of channels that are joined when logarithm starts.

	servers:
		A list of servers logarithm will try to connect to.  Only one
		server will be connected to at a time.

	plugins:
		A list of plugins that are loaded when logarithm starts.

	command_path:
		A list of directories from which commands are loaded when
		logarithm starts.

Global or Per-Channel Options:
	command_designator:
		The prefix used before commands.  This prefix must be used in
		order for a command to be run when the command is issued from
		within a channel but is optional when the command is sent as
		a private message directly to logarithm.  When this option is
		defined for a channel, it will override the global setting.
		If neither a channel nor global setting exists then '!' is
		used.  If set to "" then no prefix is required (beware using
		this).  In order to disable this option it must be erased.

	disable_all:
		Causes all commands to be disabled by default when set to 1.
		Commands can be added on an individual basis using the
		'enabled_commands' option.  The value of this option overrides
		the global setting.

	disabled_commands:
		A list of commands which are not allowed to be used if the
		disable_all command is set to 0.  The channel specific and
		global lists are merged to get the list of commands that
		cannot be run in a specific channel.  If commands are run
		by sending a message directly to logarithm then only the global
		list is used.

	enabled_commands:
		A list of commands which are allowed if the disable_all option
		is set to 1.  The channel specific and global lists are merged
		to get a list of commands that are allowed to be run in a
		specific channel.  IF commands are run by sending a message
		directly to logarithm then only the global list is used.
