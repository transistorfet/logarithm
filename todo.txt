	* make a link command that stores a list of links for each channel (using config where the first
	  value is always the link and the second is an optional description).  The file could be displayed
	  on the website as well but is used for named links???

	* add a license and copyright file before the next release
	* Add Line Length Limiter to break up lines longer than the max
	* should the default access level be really high instead of 0 (in case an error causes the
	  module_info to not be defined or set to 0?)

	* there is a problem where if a module is reloaded, any variable values are erased which causes
	  problems with plugins (install_dir for example is cleared).  should init_plugin be called every
	  time after a module is loaded?

	* an fserve/dcc plugin maybe that allows people to upload files and then download them with a 
	  system of quotas for uploaders and stuff.  There could be a dcc plugin seperately that uses
	  hooks to communicate with other plugins that use the dcc features
	* a command that randomly prints something from one of the site blogs?
	* french plugin for #french that greets and chats with people in french (possibly french trivia/word
	  testing) as well as a french dictionary.
	* messages system so that people can leave others messages (maybe autoprint on join + access commands)
	  (this is like memoserv so is it needed?)
	* have a list of recomened readings
	* Quote feature
	* Signifigant events list (?)

	* Add date specifier to search page to limit the range of the search
	* Make the php search page nicer/quicker/etc
	* Add support for Multiple Hostmasks
	* Multiserver??

	* possibly add threading for commands or plugins so that you don't have to worry about
	  making evreything event driven?
