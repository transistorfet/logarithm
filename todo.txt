	* make ListFile put quotes around entries, at least if they contain the seperator char
	* add logging of commands (for security)

	* can you make the help system use info to get the priv settings for displaying in the help?
	* you could maybe make a perl script that compiles the help from the commands into a webpage?
	* update the web help page
	* update README, changelog mabye, and scripting.txt?

--- Release as 0.9

Bugs:

	* fix imgcache's timestamp update code to correctly update the timestamp of files that don't exactly
	  match the url filename (files with %20 in the url are saved to filenames with them converted to
	  spaces, so extracting the url's filename doesn't always work because wget will use a different name)

General:

	* make a plugin to facilitate D&D hosting
	* add a response system so that basic matched patterns in chat can trigger logarithm to respond
	  in a certain way (possibly one of many responses) like Bucket in #xkcd

	* make a command to forcefully reload all modules manually. (it should probably forcefully unload all
	  modules first (allowing purging to take place) and then reload them all.
	* would logging pings help with finding the problem where logarithm occationally stops working.  The
	  last time this happened, logarithm went full CPU and wouldn't restart
	* make it so that topics in topicifier can be tagged and can be selected based on tags
	* add command to topicifier to reshuffle the topics

	* make it possible to use logarithm as basically a perl based irc client in 2 possible fashions.
	  First, with a direct frontend of some kind, and then also with an OSC process with an independant
	  frontend either written in perl or in C using the stutter code

	* add line length limiter to break up lines longer than the max
	* modify the date command to have a stored timezone for each user such that if that user runs the
	  command or someone types !date <user>, it uses their timezone for printing the date
	* make a command for the polls that informs a user of which polls that user hasn't vote in yet
	  as well as possibly the opposite (which ones he/she has voted for)

	* make definitions accept wildcards but you'd have to limit the number of responses

	* should plugins that register a channel specific something (timer or hook) always also hook the
	  irc messages and deregister when logarithm leaves a channel? (only affects wordtest)

	* make a link command that stores a list of links for each channel (using config where the first
	  value is always the link and the second is an optional description).  The file could be displayed
	  on the website as well but is used for named links???  This is for quick links so people can easily
	  make and reference links to give other people

	* Add support for Multiple Hostmasks
	* add the ability to use the current hostmask if none is given when set (is this even possible)?

Website:

	* Add date specifier to search page to limit the range of the search
	* Make the php search page nicer/quicker/etc

	* perhaps you could make a todo list thing with a web-based access portal as well.  How would web
	  stuff play into plugins?  Perhaps you could have a special access page in public_html that takes
	  a GET parameter of what plugin and page you want to access and it includes that page from the
	  plugins/<name>/public_html/ page

Features:

	* make a plugin that records ++ and -- commands somehow somewhy
	* make a calander feature for keeping track of events complete with reminders
	* a command that randomly prints something from one of the site blogs?
	* messages system so that people can leave others messages (maybe autoprint on join + access commands)
	  (this is like memoserv so is it needed?)
	* have a list of recomened readings
	* an fserve/dcc plugin maybe that allows people to upload files and then download them with a 
	  system of quotas for uploaders and stuff.  There could be a dcc plugin seperately that uses
	  hooks to communicate with other plugins that use the dcc features

	* Quote feature
	* Signifigant events list (?)
	* Multiserver?? (Complicated and unnecessary, just run multiple copies of the program)
