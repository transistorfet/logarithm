	* plugin initialization doesn't work for some reason, even though it *seemed* like commands did
	* rename plugins to Plugins, various other capitals all over
	* sholud you move Commands/ to a core plugin?

	* in plugins, instead of putting 'use <package>;', you could do a dynamic load using Module.pm and
	  hopefully, if it uses require perhaps, it will be identical to 'use', except since a module entry
	  is in the list, the loaded module will be reloadable
	* make a command to reload modules manually.  It only should reload modules directly loaded using
	  Module.pm
	* add a function to load and initialize a plugin (either in module or in a new Plugin.pm)

	* add logging of commands
	* could you make it so that various hooks (and bassically all callbacks) can only have one per
	  module per function, such that trying to set a callback where one already exists will replace
	  the old callback.  If you need chaining, that could be done on a module by module basis.  Then
	  you can have the module init be called again after the module is reloaded so that it changes all
	  the calbacks.  You could also maybe have a way to tell if a callback is no longer valid(???).  Also
	  is there a way to make it so that you cal much more easily make plugins?

	* make logarithm write the pid file somewhere so that it can be controlled via a command line
	  controller like unreal and anoperc
	* make a daemon command line option that starts logarithm in daemon mode (detaches) which disables
	  outputting of status messages (or rather make it redirect I/O to files).

	* make a plugin to facilitate D&D hosting
	* combine the topicifier and topic list into one, even without the fancy changes
	* merge topicifier and the old topics system and make it so that topics can be tagged (at any time)
	  and so that topics can be selected based on tags
	* add command to topicifier to reshuffle the topics

	* fix imgcache's timestamp update code to correctly update the timestamp of files that don't exactly
	  match the url filename (files with %20 in the url are saved to filenames with them converted to
	  spaces, so extracting the url's filename doesn't always work because wget will use a different name)

	* would logging pings help with finding the problem where logarithm occationally stops working.  The
	  last time this happened, logarithm went full CPU and wouldn't restart

	* you could possibly make TopicList be a simple mod found by using use lib '.';
	* make a function that returns the etc/ directory so that plugins don't need to store that somewhere
	* make ListFile put quotes around entries, at least if they contain the seperator char

	* convert the wordtest and trivia plugins to use the new timer (and hook and command) systems
	* can you make the help system use info to get the priv settings for displaying in the help?

	* you could maybe make a perl script that compiles the help from the commands into a webpage?
	* update the web help page

--- Release as 0.9

General:

	* add a response system so that basic matched patterns in chat can trigger logarithm to respond
	  in a certain way (possibly one of many responses) like Bucket in #xkcd

	* make it possible to use logarithm as basically a perl based irc client in 2 possible fashions.
	  First, with a direct frontend of some kind, and then also with an OSC process with an independant
	  frontend either written in perl or in C using the stutter code

	* add line length limiter to break up lines longer than the max
	* modify the date command to have a stored timezone for each user such that if that user runs the
	  command or someone types !date <user>, it uses their timezone for printing the date
	* make a command for the polls that informs a user of which polls that user hasn't vote in yet
	  as well as possibly the opposite (which ones he/she has voted for)

	* make definitions accept wildcards but you'd have to limit the number of responses

	* should plugins that register a channel specific something (timer or hook) always also hook the
	  irc messages and deregister when logarithm leaves a channel? (only affects wordtest)

	* make a link command that stores a list of links for each channel (using config where the first
	  value is always the link and the second is an optional description).  The file could be displayed
	  on the website as well but is used for named links???  This is for quick links so people can easily
	  make and reference links to give other people

	* Add support for Multiple Hostmasks

Website:

	* Add date specifier to search page to limit the range of the search
	* Make the php search page nicer/quicker/etc

	* perhaps you could make a todo list thing with a web-based access portal as well.  How would web
	  stuff play into plugins?  Perhaps you could have a special access page in public_html that takes
	  a GET parameter of what plugin and page you want to access and it includes that page from the
	  plugins/<name>/public_html/ page

Features:

	* make a plugin that records ++ and -- commands somehow somewhy
	* make a calander feature for keeping track of events complete with reminders
	* a command that randomly prints something from one of the site blogs?
	* messages system so that people can leave others messages (maybe autoprint on join + access commands)
	  (this is like memoserv so is it needed?)
	* have a list of recomened readings
	* an fserve/dcc plugin maybe that allows people to upload files and then download them with a 
	  system of quotas for uploaders and stuff.  There could be a dcc plugin seperately that uses
	  hooks to communicate with other plugins that use the dcc features

	* Quote feature
	* Signifigant events list (?)
	* Multiserver?? (Complicated and unnecessary, just run multiple copies of the program)
