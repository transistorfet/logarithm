	* make a function that returns the etc/ directory so that plugins don't need to store that somewhere
	* the anti-flood queue is not flushed on a regular basis with the new selector system
	* the purge functions don't work now because the package that most handlers point to is actually
	  Module (because they call Module::call which then calls the actual module's function).

	* convert the wordtest and trivia plugins to use the new timer (and hook and command) systems
	* can you make the help system use info to get the priv settings for displaying in the help?
	* move the ping timeout code into the IRC module


	* should you move what is now in main() (most of it at least) to a Logarithm.pm module that forms
	  the core of the system with as much funny/misc stuff moved there as possible and still have a
	  script that can easily be written to make the bot do lots of customizable things (custom speech,
	  direct inline commands, etc).
	* make it possible to use logarithm as basically a perl based irc client in 2 possible fashions.
	  First, with a direct frontend of some kind, and then also with an OSC process with an independant
	  frontend either written in perl or in C using the stutter code
	* this would work nicely (probably) if you transition to a Logarithm:: namespace
	* make an OSC control plugin

	* merge topicifier and the old topics system and make it so that topics can be tagged (at any time)
	  and so that topics can be selected based on tags
	* modify the date command to have a stored timezone for each user such that if that user runs the
	  command or someone types !date <user>, it uses their timezone for printing the date
	* make a command for the polls that informs a user of which polls that user hasn't vote in yet
	  as well as possibly the opposite (which ones he/she has voted for)

	* make a daemon command line option that starts logarithm in daemon mode (detaches) which disables
	  outputting of status messages
	* Add Line Length Limiter to break up lines longer than the max

	* make a plugin that records ++ and -- commands somehow somewhy

	* make definitions accept wildcards but you'd have to limit the number of responses
	* fix the autoping reconnect code stuff

	* should plugins that register a channel specific something (timer or hook) always also hook the
	  irc messages and deregister when logarithm leaves a channel? (only affects wordtest)
	* if you try to make it multiserver, there has to be a way to keep logs in network directories and
	  probably the same for etc/ files.

	* should the default access level be really high instead of 0 (in case an error causes the
	  module_info to not be defined or set to 0?)

	* make a calander feature for keeping track of events complete with reminders
	* perhaps you could make a todo list thing with a web-based access portal as well.  How would web
	  stuff play into plugins?  Perhaps you could have a special access page in public_html that takes
	  a GET parameter of what plugin and page you want to access and it includes that page from the
	  plugins/<name>/public_html/ page
	* make a link command that stores a list of links for each channel (using config where the first
	  value is always the link and the second is an optional description).  The file could be displayed
	  on the website as well but is used for named links???

	* an fserve/dcc plugin maybe that allows people to upload files and then download them with a 
	  system of quotas for uploaders and stuff.  There could be a dcc plugin seperately that uses
	  hooks to communicate with other plugins that use the dcc features
	* a command that randomly prints something from one of the site blogs?
	* messages system so that people can leave others messages (maybe autoprint on join + access commands)
	  (this is like memoserv so is it needed?)
	* have a list of recomened readings
	* Quote feature
	* Signifigant events list (?)

	* Add date specifier to search page to limit the range of the search
	* Make the php search page nicer/quicker/etc
	* Add support for Multiple Hostmasks
	* Multiserver??
