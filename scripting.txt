Logarithm Command Scripting
for Version 0.5
31/05/2004


Logarithm implements commands as external perl scripts which it loads and executes when needed.  These scripts are placed in the cmd directory and must be name the command name followed by ".pm".   For example, the access command would be in a file called access.pm.  Despite the extension, these scripts are not normal perl modules.  Each script must contain a sub routine called "do_" followed by the name of the command (which must be the same as the file name of the script).  This sub routine is passed 3 parameters: $irc, $msg, and $privs.  The script may also contain other sub routines which are called/activated by the main sub routine.

The $irc paramater is the irc connection handle which is needed to pass to irc functions.  The irc functions all have a name which starts with "irc_" and take $irc as their first argument.
